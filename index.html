<h4>ILRT - What Is It?</h4>

<p>ILRT (Instrumentation Log Report Tool) is a utility I created to help detect and diagnose performance bottlenecks of <strong>IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition</strong> / <strong>IBM BPM</strong>, primarily in the Lombardi (BPMN processes) runtime. Lombardi process runtime has embedded instrumentation capabilities, and can record detailed system profile of every process or service activity. It is somehow described <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21613989">here</a>. Ðžutput of NonXMLDump utility provided by IBM is a human-readable but in fact is a big and raw instrumentation log which is very difficult to read and analyze by hand. ILRT parse such raw text instrumentation log and then produce report with statistical information and detailed aggregate profile of top expensive activities in a much more readable form.</p>

<p>Example of such report output can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/afedotov/ILRT/raw/master/example-reports/inst001.report.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is very first version created to address some common problems, so it was written quick using <strong>Ruby</strong> language. It is very helpful, works well, but not as fast as we would like. Maybe someday I'll rewrite it on something more performant, Scala for example.</p>
